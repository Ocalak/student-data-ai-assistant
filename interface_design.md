# AI Assistant Interface Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design of the dynamic AI Assistant interface for GitHub Pages. The interface is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing while providing powerful AI-driven insights about student data.

## User Interface Components

### 1. Header Section
- **Title**: "Student Data AI Assistant"
- **Subtitle**: Brief description of the assistant's capabilities
- **Design**: Clean, centered text with blue accent color for the title

### 2. Chat Container
- **Purpose**: Display conversation history between user and AI
- **Design**: 
  - Scrollable container with fixed height
  - User messages aligned to right with blue background
  - AI messages aligned to left with light gray background
  - Rounded corners with directional indicators
  - Automatic scrolling to most recent messages

### 3. Visualization Area
- **Purpose**: Display charts and graphs based on AI responses
- **Design**:
  - Initially hidden, shown only when visualization data is available
  - Bordered container with title
  - Responsive canvas for Chart.js visualizations
  - Smooth transition when showing/hiding

### 4. Input Section
- **Purpose**: Allow users to type questions and submit them
- **Design**:
  - Text input field with placeholder text
  - Send button with arrow icon
  - Focus styles for accessibility
  - Enter key functionality for submission

### 5. Footer
- **Purpose**: Display attribution and copyright information
- **Design**: Subtle gray text, centered at bottom of page

## Interaction Design

### Message Flow
1. User types question in input field
2. User submits question (via button or Enter key)
3. User message appears in chat container
4. Typing indicator appears to show AI is processing
5. AI response appears in chat container
6. If applicable, visualization appears below chat

### Visual Feedback
- **Typing Indicator**: Three animated dots to show AI is processing
- **Scroll Behavior**: Smooth scrolling to new messages
- **Focus States**: Clear visual indication of focused elements
- **Hover States**: Subtle changes on interactive elements

## Visualization Types
The interface supports multiple visualization types through Chart.js:

1. **Bar Charts**: For comparing values across categories (e.g., student scores)
2. **Horizontal Bar Charts**: For comparing values with longer labels
3. **Line Charts**: For showing trends over time (e.g., performance timeline)
4. **Scatter Plots**: For showing relationships between variables (e.g., time vs. score)

## Responsive Design
The interface adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop**: Full layout with ample spacing
- **Tablet**: Maintained layout with adjusted spacing
- **Mobile**: 
  - Increased message width for readability
  - Maintained functionality with touch-friendly targets
  - Responsive visualizations

## Accessibility Considerations
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Sufficient color contrast
- Focus management
- Alternative text for visualizations (via titles and descriptions)

## Technical Implementation
- **HTML**: Semantic structure with appropriate ARIA attributes
- **CSS**: 
  - Custom styles for chat interface
  - Tailwind CSS for layout and utility classes
  - Animations for typing indicator
- **JavaScript**:
  - Event listeners for user interactions
  - Dynamic content generation
  - Chart.js integration for visualizations
  - Mock API responses for demonstration

## Future Enhancements
- Theme switching (light/dark mode)
- User preferences storage
- Message history persistence
- Additional visualization types
- Voice input/output capabilities
