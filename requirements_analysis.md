# GitHub Pages AI Assistant Requirements Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the requirements for creating a dynamic AI Assistant that can be hosted on GitHub Pages while connecting to a backend service for AI functionality.

## GitHub Pages Constraints
- GitHub Pages only serves static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- No server-side code execution (PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.)
- Cannot directly run backend services or databases
- Limited to client-side processing

## Dynamic AI Assistant Requirements
1. **User Interface**
   - Clean, modern design
   - Chat-like interface for questions and answers
   - Support for displaying visualizations
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

2. **Frontend Functionality**
   - Input field for user questions
   - Display area for AI responses
   - Ability to render visualizations based on responses
   - History of previous questions and answers
   - Loading indicators for API calls

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Need external API service for AI functionality
   - Options:
     - OpenAI API (GPT models)
     - Hugging Face Inference API
     - Custom API deployed on a service like Vercel, Netlify Functions, or AWS Lambda
   - CORS handling for cross-origin requests
   - API key management (client-side security considerations)

4. **Data Handling**
   - Pre-computed dataset insights for common questions
   - JSON data files for static information
   - Client-side data processing for simple queries
   - Backend processing for complex queries

## Technical Solution Approach

### Frontend Stack
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 with modern framework (Tailwind CSS) for styling
- JavaScript (ES6+) for interactivity
- Chart.js or D3.js for visualizations

### Backend Options
1. **Serverless Functions**
   - Vercel Serverless Functions
   - Netlify Functions
   - AWS Lambda

2. **API Gateway**
   - Connect to existing AI services
   - Handle authentication and rate limiting

### Integration Strategy
1. Create static GitHub Pages site with HTML/CSS/JS
2. Implement frontend UI with chat interface
3. Set up serverless function for AI processing
4. Connect frontend to serverless backend via API calls
5. Deploy GitHub Pages site and serverless functions separately
6. Document the setup and usage

## Implementation Plan
1. Design and implement the static frontend
2. Create a separate repository or service for the backend functionality
3. Implement API endpoints for AI assistant functionality
4. Connect the GitHub Pages frontend to the backend API
5. Test the integrated solution
6. Deploy and document

## Security Considerations
- API keys should not be embedded in client-side code
- Use environment variables in serverless functions
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Consider user authentication for production use

## Limitations
- Free tier API limits may restrict usage
- Response time depends on external API service
- GitHub Pages bandwidth limitations for high-traffic sites

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Design the AI Assistant interface
3. Implement the frontend components
4. Develop the backend integration
5. Test and deploy the solution
